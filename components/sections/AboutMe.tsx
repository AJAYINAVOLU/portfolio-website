              After spending three years as a machine learning professional, I decided to return to school to pursue my master's degree. This journey significantly enhanced my skills as a problem-solver and critical thinker. I deepened my understanding of designing efficient algorithms, a vital aspect of building scalable systems. Along the way, I developed a passion for coding challenges, turning them into enjoyable and rewarding opportunities to sharpen my skills.            </p>

            </ul>
            <p>
            Currently, I'm deeply immersed in exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) while indulging in web development as a side hobby. I enjoy staying updated on the latest technical innovations from leading tech companies, which constantly inspire me to enhance my skills. As a firm believer in lifelong learning and self-improvement, I embrace every opportunity to grow and expand my knowledge, no matter the circumstances.            </p>
