              <FaCode className="inline-block mr-2" /> 

              After gaining hands-on experience as a Full Stack Software Engineer, I decided to pursue my Master&apos;s in Computer Science to deepen my expertise in scalable system design, cloud computing, and distributed architectures. This journey has significantly enhanced my problem-solving and critical thinking skills, allowing me to refine my approach to building efficient algorithms and optimizing system performance. Along the way, I developed a passion for solving complex coding challenges, turning them into opportunities to push my technical boundaries and continuously evolve as an engineer.            </p>
            <p>
              When I&apos;m not crunching numbers or coding, you might find me:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><SiShowtime className="inline-block mr-2" /> Watching anime (Naruto and Onepiece are my all-time favourites)</li>
              <li><FaBookReader className="inline-block mr-2" /> Reading books (currently reading Atomic Habits)</li>
              <li><GiSoccerKick className="inline-block mr-2" /> Playing soccer (GGMU!!!)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Currently, I&apos;m deeply engaged in building scalable full-stack applications while exploring the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and cloud-native architectures. I stay updated on the latest technological advancements from leading tech companies, drawing inspiration to refine my skills and explore cutting-edge innovations. As a firm believer in lifelong learning and continuous improvement, I embrace every challenge as an opportunity to grow, expand my knowledge, and push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. </p>
